# Dorks
This project was modeled on Wells Fargo banking.  The site includes 29 webpages designed by Reni with MySQL queries by Matt and Will with
for a banking database that was implemented on a webdev server.  For the source code to work database tables and field names must be named 
the same as our implementation, or the queries and php code (championed by Connor) must be adjusted to match the tables and columns of 
other users. Correct database implementations are limiteless and open to interpretation so please don't feel obligated to attempt to 
recreate our work.  My hope is that you could discover your own way of doing things....or that you just dropped by to admire our handy-work.

Cheers!
